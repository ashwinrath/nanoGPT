# nanoGPT

The simplest, fastest repository for training/finetuning medium-sized GPTs. It is a rewrite of [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) but it adds support for DML so i can use my puny Inter GPU on my laptop and not have a 100% CPU while running the training !. Also added a word level GPT for warehouses with some fictitious warehouse data. The original nanoGPT is char level.
